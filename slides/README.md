# What is cocotb

* cocotb is a COroutine based COsimulation TestBench environment for verifying VHDL and SystemVerilog RTL using Python.
* cocotb is completely free, open source (under the BSD License) and hosted on GitHub.

Translation: Cocotb is a Python based verification framework for simulating RTL written using Verilog/VHDL or SV.

# Learning Journey

* Hello world. OR Gate.
* Interfaces
* Randomization
* Drivers
* Monitors
* Scoreboards
* Coverage
	* Functional coverage
		* Bins and cross coverage 
	* CRV
* BFM's: AXI, APB, Wishbone, Avalon, PCIe, Ethernet, UART, SPI, I2C...

# Getting started

* https://docs.cocotb.org/en/stable/
* [Github Classroom](https://classroom.github.com/classrooms/115061083-learn-cocotb-classroom)

# Example "or Gate"

A 2 input OR Gate is represented by the truth table

| a  | b  | y  |
| -- | -- | -- |
| 0  | 0  | 0  |
| 0  | 1  | 1  |
| 1  | 0  | 1  |
| 1  | 1  | 1  |

Where a and b are inputs to the gate and y is the output.

# Assignment: "XOR gate verification"

# Interface
* Data transfer takes place from Data Producer to Data Consumer.
* Producers take $t_p$ cycles to produce a unit of data
* Consumers can accept data every $t_c$ cycles
* In most cases, Producers need to hold data until consumer can consume it or consumers need to wait for data from Producers.
* There are various signalling scheme to ensure that data transfer takes place iff producer has data and consumer can accept the data.

# Interfaces: Simple RDY/EN protocol specification.

* Producers assert RDY when they have data to offer and keep it asserted until EN is asserted
* Consumers assert RDY when they can consume data and keep it asserted until EN is asserted
* EN is asserted when both Producer.RDY and COnsumer.RDY are asserted.

# Protocol Verification

Based on the protocol description we have the following truth table

| Data       | En | Rdy | Description |
| --         | -- | --  | --          |
| dont care  | 0  | 0   | Idle        |
| valid data | 0  | 1   | Ready       |
| valid data | 1  | 1   | Transaction |

* The case where En is 1 and Rdy is 0 cannot occur.
* Once Rdy goes high data cannot change until transaction completes. En goes high.
* We need to verify all state transition
 
# State transition verification

| Previous State | Current State |
| ---            | ---           |
| Idle           | Idle          |
| Idle           | Ready         |
| Idle           | Transaction   |
| Ready          | Idle          |
| Ready          | Ready         |
| Ready          | Transaction   |
| Transaction    | Idle          |
| Transaction    | Ready         |
| Transaction    | Transaction   |

# Cross Verification

| A State     | B State     |
| ---         | ---         |
| Idle        | Idle        |
| Idle        | Ready       |
| Idle        | Transaction |
| Ready       | Idle        |
| Ready       | Ready       |
| Ready       | Transaction |
| Transaction | Idle        |
| Transaction | Ready       |
| Transaction | Transaction |

# Assignment FIFO interface verification

FIFO interface has a similar protocol to the EN/RDY protocol.

* Data source signals are 
	* not_empty, dout, dequeue
* Data sink signals are
	* not_full, din, enqueue

A transaction takes place when:

* Source is not empty and
* Sink is not full,

 The corresponding sink.enqueue and source.dequeue signals are asserted when the transfer takes place.

# Development and verification with Cocotb is fast

While the actual simulation speed might be slower than a simulation on a commercial simulation with native support for SV+UVM, Overall verification with cocotb is fast because of the following factors.

* Fast development
	* In my experience we can get a basic cocotb based test env up within hours.
* Fast regression.
	* Commercial simulator licenses are expensive, regressions parallism will be limited by available licenses.
	* With cocotb + Icarus We can fire all out testcases at the same time resulting in lesser overall regression time.
* Agile workflow
	* With commercial simulator, the number of regressions that can be fired by a team/week is restricted due to cost factor. Typically developers have to wait for the weekly regression to get feedback on their checkins.
	* With cocotb + icarus we can fire regression on every checkin resulting in continous and quick feedback loop.
